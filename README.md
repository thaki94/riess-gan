This repository contains the supplementary online materials of our work All Weather Radar Image Enhancement and Semantic Segmentation Method for Autonomous Vehicles. The proposed method is a generative adversarial networks (GANs) based method for enhancement and semantic segmentation of radar images for autonomous navigation applications. The inference phase of the proposed method is shown in the Figure 1.
